Brick-Breaker
=============

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive version of the game brick breaker using an  FPGA. It will be programmed using Vhdl. The game will require a design of graphics, , and the creation of a square ball, and a paddle. Also I need to work on the aspects of the control of the  ball. This also includes the ball interactions with the paddle, walls, bricks, and how to stop it  from going out of bounds.
